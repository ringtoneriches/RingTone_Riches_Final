              Ringtone Riches 'spin wheel' & other instant win wheels
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p>
                The prize for any wheel competitions is assigned at random at the point of order, any wheel spin competitions featuring a wheel are operated as the other competitions and the wheel is an aesthetic feature for show. Should the wheel spin itself malfunction in any way, any win is at the discretion of Ringtone Riches management & director. The wheel spin will guarantee a single cash prize or site credit per spin, anything other than this would be classed as a malfunction. Another example of a malfunction would be the wheel landing on a prize of £4 for example, but during the spin identifying another prize amount. Instant win wheel competitions are all applicable for entrants to enter for FREE via postal entry and this is displayed in line with all other competitions.
              </p>
              <p>
                'Win every spin' – We do not guarantee winning a cash prize on every spin, we guarantee to win a prize every spin that would be either a cash prize or site credit. The wheel artwork will display Cash prizes as '£500 cash for example' & site credits as '100 site credits' as another example. The actual aesthetic display for the wheel that spins display Cash prizes as a £ money bag symbol & the Site Credits as a token symbol. Once the wheel has span it will clearly display your prize in writing as an example: £2 Cash or 50 Ringtone Points. Ringtone Points is the same thing as site credits. In addition to this, you will also receive an email notifying you of the prize you have won. If this is a Ringtone Points then that will automatically update your account and if it's a cash prize we will contact you to arrange payment.
