            <p>
              Ringtone Riches is a promoter of skill-based prize competitions
              which allocate prizes in accordance with these Terms & Conditions
              on the website www.ringtoneriches.co.uk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ringtone Riches, 1 West Havelock Street, South Shields, Tyne &

            <p>
              The Promoter may run multiple competitions at any one time, each
              with a predetermined prize. Each competition contains a skill,
              knowledge, or judgment question that must be answered correctly to
              qualify for entry. This ensures that participation is based on
              skill rather than pure chance.

              Entry Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>
              To enter, the entrant must answer the competition question
              correctly (when applicable) and pay the advertised entry fee in
              GBP (UK) or EUR (Republic of Ireland) via the website’s secure
              payment gateway.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every valid entry is assigned unique ticket numbers into the
              relevant draw.
            </p>
            <p>
              The winner will be chosen at random once the maximum number of
              entries has been reached or the end date arrives. Proof of
              identity and age must be provided before any prize is released. A
              prize cannot be collected on behalf of another person. With the
              winner’s consent, the Promoter may publish photos or testimonials
              on its website and social-media pages.

              within 72 hours. The Promoter may, at its discretion, award the
              prize even if the maximum number of paid entries has not been met.
